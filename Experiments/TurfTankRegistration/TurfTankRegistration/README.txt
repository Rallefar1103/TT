This is an experimental build of the TurfTankRegistration app, so as to create a barebones project (ie. some models, a view, and some testing)
It should be seen as a prototype and NOT the final build!

Ideas for improvement:
- Models should be organised into their seperate contexts/clusters (ie. Robot + Components, SimCard + GPS + Tablet, Employee + Production/Storage)
- It is uncertain how the Application Domain should be presented (i have chosen a "One User System", with the Employee as the main (abstract) user)
